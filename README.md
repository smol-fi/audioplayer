# audioplayer

Simple audioplayer for a school project written in JS, (fairly) responsively designed to function on multiple screen sizes.

Audio and cover images not shared for licensing reasons. Edit songs in the songs array to suit your liking.
Songs go by default in an \"audio\" folder in the root directory. Cover images go in an \"img\" folder in the root directory.
By default, audio files are assumed to be in .mp3-format and named 1-, 2- and 3.mp3. Cover images are assumed to be named 1-, 2- and 3.jpg and to be equal in height and width.
